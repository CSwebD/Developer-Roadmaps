                <p class="paragraph"><br>The introduction of AI provides a platform to understand the vast and rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence. This foundational module aims to introduce students to the basic concepts, historical context, and current developments that define AI today.
                    <br>Course content and history of AI
                    <br>Course overview and objectives
                    <br>- Welcome and Introduction: In the first session, students are introduced to the curriculum, objectives and expectations. It describes the topics to be covered, the lectures, labs, and projects, as well as the research methods.
                    <br>- Learning Outcomes: At the end of this unit, students should be able to define AI, identify its applications, and understand its historical development.
                    <br>History of AI.
                    <br>- Origin Theory: The idea of ​​intelligent artificial beings can be traced back to ancient myths. However, AI began to be formally studied in the mid-20th century.
                    <br>- Key Highlights:
                    In the 1950s, Alan Turing's landmark paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" asked the question: "Can machines reason?" and introduced the Turing test.
                    1956: The Dartmouth conference coined the term "artificial intelligence," and AI was born as a field of study.
                    1960s-1970s: ELIZA, a chatbot masquerading as a Rogerian psychiatrist, the first general-purpose mobile robot, developed early AI programs like Shakey
                    1980s: Rise of expert systems that used rules-based systems to simulate human experts.
                    1990s: IBM Deep Blue Club defeated world chess champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, demonstrating the power of AI in strategy games.
                    2000s-present: Advances in machine learning and deep learning have led to advances in a variety of applications, including image language recognition, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing.</p>
